jbabel
======
It is a jQuery extension that allow you to translate web pages using JavaScript in a easy and friendly way.

Cordova friendly
================
It is very easy to translate Cordova apps using jababel. 

Indexable
=========
jbabel pages are indexable, soon I will release a howto to teach how to build it. 


Why/When to translate pages in client side?
===========================================
If you are building an web app using RIA and Ajax you probably don't want to reload the page just because the user changed the language, in this case you can use jBabel.
